            <p>
                How can you call this your first week of pregnancy if you're not even pregnant? It’s extremely hard for your
                practitioner to pinpoint the precise moment pregnancy begins (when sperm meets egg).
                <br>So in order to give all pregnancies some standard timing, most practitioners use the first day of your
                last menstrual period as the starting line of your 40-week pregnancy. Still confused? Think of it as a head
                start — you're clocking in roughly two weeks of pregnancy before you even conceive!</br>
                <br></br>
            <h4>Your Body at Week 1</h4> Your menstrual cycle is orchestrated by a symphony of hormones working in concert
            with one another. The first to kick in is FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) which — you guessed it — stimulates
            the follicles to mature, some faster than others.
            <br>A second hormone, lutenizing hormone (LH), increases around day 5 and also works with FSH to stimulate the
            follicles. Each follicle contains an egg, and each month only one follicle becomes the dominant one, destined
            for ovulation.</br>
            <br> As the follicles mature, they produce another hormone, estrogen, which does two things. First, it
            encourages the lining of the uterus to begin thickening again. Second, once a high enough level of estrogen is
            reached, it will trigger a spike in the production of LH.</br>
            <br> Believe it or not, the countdown to delivery day begins now, during the period before fertilization — even
            though egg and sperm haven't even been in the same room (or womb!).

            And if you don't get pregnant this time around, don't stress: The average, healthy couple in their 20s and early
            30s have about a 25 to 30 percent chance of getting pregnant with each cycle.</br>
            <br></br>

            <h4>Pro Insights for a Successful Week Ahead</h4>
            <h6><b>Fill up on folic acid</b></h6>There's no doubt that your body works overtime when you're expecting — so
            help give it the extra nutrients it needs to baby-build by getting 400 to 600 micrograms of folic acid daily
            from all sources, including your prenatal vitamin and folate-rich foods.
            <br> Folic acid (and its natural form, folate) can help reduce the risk of birth defects including congenital
            heart and neural tube defects in your baby, and has even been shown to lower your chances of gestational
            diabetes, preterm labor and miscarriage.</br>

            <br></br>
            <h6><b>Seek Medical Advice Regarding Medications</b></h6>If you’re taking a prescription, OTC or herbal med, ask
            your doctor ASAP about whether it’s safe to continue it during pregnancy.
            <br> Herbal preparations are not tested or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are not
            required to undergo clinical trials. Translation: Their safety, or lack thereof, is unknown.</br>
            <br>Even herbs that you've heard could be helpful during pregnancy may be harmful at some point during the next
            nine months. So always get the green light from your practitioner before taking any medication or herbal
            supplement of any kind.</br>

            <br></br>
            <h6><b>Recognizing Early Pregnancy Symptoms</b></h6>You could be weeks away from taking a pregnancy test, but
            Mother Nature may give you a heads-up in the form of early pregnancy symptoms.
            <br> Some, like a heightened sense of smell and tender breasts, can show up before you even miss your period,
            while others, like spotting and urinary frequency, happen a week or two after conception.</br>
            <br>Haven't noticed any new symptoms? Plenty of women won't feel any until at least a few weeks or more into
            their pregnancies — and some lucky few won't notice any at all!</br>
